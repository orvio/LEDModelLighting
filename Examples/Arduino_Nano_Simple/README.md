#Ardunio Nano Every example

This folder holds the sketch for a simple light control.

The first light turns on and off randomly avery couple of minutes. The other two lights do the same, but only turn on when the first light is active. All lights have 500ms fade in and fade out effect.

The KiCad folder contains the schematics and the PCB design for a lightboard designed to work with an Arduino Nano Every. It should also work with a regular Arduino Nano.
